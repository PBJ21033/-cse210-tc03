Hi my name is Peter Benson. I am hoping to become a Software Architect and I am working on a big program that I am hoping will be good enough to get me an internship. I love playing Volleyball and won state in high school. I program a lot for fun and I love playing Magic. I am really excited for this semester!

My name is Devin Johnson. I am a computer engineering major in my fourth semester of study. I am from Idaho Falls and enjoy spending time outdoors. I love to mountain bike and to play disc golf. I enjoy working with computers and learning about how they work and can improve our lives. I hope to learn a lot in this class and in my future semesters here at BYU-I.
