Hi my name is Peter Benson. I am hoping to become a Software Architect and I am working on a big program that I am hoping will be good enough to get me an internship. I love playing Volleyball and won state in high school. I program a lot for fun and I love playing Magic. I am really excited for this semester!

Hello, my name is Jadan White. I am a data science major and in my first semester here at BYU-I. I rock climb for fun and enjoy pretty much anything with computers. I have a long history with python but looking forward to learn more.
